1. create a struct representing neural network
2. a neural network can have many layers
3. a layer can have many neurons
4. a neuron can have many output weights (synapse) and one bias
5. write propagate function for the neural network, layer and neuron
6. write random function to randomize the weights and biases
7. test these above
